Memes are basic units of cultural transmission or imitation that propagates  among  individuals through copying or mimicking behaviors. As it spreads, it mutates and changes, just like a virus 
would, or a gene would mutate.

In recent political movements, memes have been instrumentalized to spread political discourse and bolster advocacy and literacy efforts, rapidly circulating ideas that 
distill complex issues into accessible, impactful narratives. Their viral nature have been enabling swift dissemination, helping movements gain momentum and 
challenge dominant power structures.
